Cryptography enables people to communicate on the Internet, transferring crucial and confidential information securely. Therefore, cryptography permits users to use public or private media such as the internet to do online shopping and evade being victims of criminals and password sniffers. Cryptography, also known as cryptology, thus helps users and institutions to cipher and decipher hidden messages into codes, ciphers, and numbers so information can be transmitted safely.  The sole purpose of cryptography is to protect the information, email, credit card details, and other personal data transmitted across a public network. Since 1994, it has been known that RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) can be broken by universal quantum computers. One of the grand challenges in cryptographic research is the development of cryptographic primitives and protocols that withstand attacks even by quantum computers. As a newcomer who has just entered the field of computer security, the challenge that may be encountered during the implementation of this project is the robustness and feasibility of the algorithm. We hope to design a UI implementing algorithms with certain encryption strengths. Each member of the team will be responsible for implementing one or more of the encryption/decryption algorithms, and we will design and implement a UI to integrate these algorithms. Each algorithm will have an input and output, and the algorithm will have certain level of robustness, the system will be stable and be implemented with Python. Initial solution of UI designing is to use Pycharm+Pyqt5.
