# CSDS_444_project_24
Part I: Project Type
Our team's final project will be a security project about cryptography. We will implement
several enciphering and deciphering algorithms and provide a GUI interface for users to
experience the result of these algorithms.
Part II: Project Description
Problem
Cryptography is a crucial instrument to protect information that is communicated using
computers. Cryptography is an artistic transformation of data into an unreadable format so
that only the intended recipient can understand and use it.  Hence, generally speaking,
cryptography is all about protecting and safeguarding information from cybercriminals or
anyone else other than the intended recipient.
Importance
Cryptography enables people to communicate on the Internet, transferring crucial and
confidential information securely. Therefore, cryptography permits users to use public or
private media such as the internet to do online shopping and evade being victims of
criminals and password sniffers. Cryptography, also known as cryptology, thus helps users
and institutions to cipher and decipher hidden messages into codes, ciphers, and numbers
so information can be transmitted safely.  The sole purpose of cryptography is to protect the
information, email, credit card details, and other personal data transmitted across a public
network.
Challenges
Since 1994, it has been known that RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) can be
broken by universal quantum computers. One of the grand challenges in cryptographic
research is the development of cryptographic primitives and protocols that withstand attacks
even by quantum computers. As a newcomer who has just entered the field of computer
security, the challenge that may be encountered during the implementation of this project is
the robustness and feasibility of the algorithm. We hope to design a UI implementing
algorithms with certain encryption strengths.
Proposed Solution
Each member of the team will be responsible for implementing one or more of the
encryption/decryption algorithms, and we will design and implement a UI to integrate these
algorithms. Each algorithm will have an input and output, and the algorithm will have certain
level of robustness, the system will be stable and be implemented with Python. Initial
solution of UI designing is to use Pycharm+Pyqt5.
Results
In the final application, we will provide a GUI which allows users to select a file, key(s), and
cipher algorithm to decrypt or encrypt the files.
