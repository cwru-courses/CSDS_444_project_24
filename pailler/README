This is the Paillier method worked by Weiqi Yue.
The main part are 4 jupyter notebook ipynb files.

Paillier string.ipynb is for string encoding
Paillier black and white img decode.ipynb is for black and white img encoding
Paillier rbg img encode and decode.ipynb is for colored img encoding
Both of the img encoding is based on rrt.png image file

encode video.ipynb is for video encoding of video.mp4 file
The encode.mp4 is the result after encryption with paillier
The decode.mp4 is the result after decrytion
